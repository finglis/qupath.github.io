## July 2022: What's happening

**QuPath (v0.4.0) is coming soon!**.
I think it's a pretty exciting release.
There are a few more things to add before it's ready, but hopefully they'll be done before the end of August.

Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for a sneak preview - or even [build it from source](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/reference/building.html) if you want to explore early.

Meanwhile, you can find us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/qupath), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/qupath) and [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tag/qupath).
