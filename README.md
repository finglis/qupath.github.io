## March 2021: We need your help!

It's grant application time again -- which means planning for the future and trying to convince funding bodies that [QuPath](http://qupath.github.io) is important.

**Please help us by completing our [QuPath User Survey](https://edinburgh.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/qupath-user-survey-2021)!**

By participating, you not only help us to establish QuPath's continued existence, but also to shape our priorities. This isn't just about adding new software features and improving the existing ones: we'd really appreciate your views on training opportunities, support models, research collaborations, and community events as we aim to make the software as useful as possible for researchers worldwide.

**Thanks!**

* New methods of thresholding images ([link](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/thresholding.html))
* New & improved tools to create & adjust annotations ([link](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/starting/annotating.html))
* Much more support for multiplexed images ([link](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/multiplex_analysis.html))
* Updated object hierarchy ([link](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/concepts/object_hierarchy.html))
* Bigger, better, smarter projects ([link](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/projects.html))
* Export images & annotations, including pyramidal OME-TIFFs ([link](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/advanced/exporting_images.html))
* *Many* bug fixes, performance improvements... and a lot more ([link](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))

> **Important!** It is not recommended to mix different version of QuPath for analysis. If you started a project in v0.1.2, it is probably best to continue with that version - or start again with v0.2.0.
