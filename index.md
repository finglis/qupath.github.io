## Features

### Whole slide viewing

![Whole slide viewing](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_viewer.jpg)

Fast, flexible image viewer capable of displaying whole slide images (often > 30 GB uncompressed) using dynamic color transforms (e.g. stain separation) and tracking slide navigation


### Biomarker quantification

![Biomarker quantification](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_biomarkers.jpg)

Nuclear, cytoplasmic & membranous biomarkers can all be quantified quickly using automated segmentation algorithms combined with trainable cell classification

### Tissue Microarray support

![TMA support](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_tmas.jpg)

Automated dearraying of Tissue Microarrays and the ability to view related cores side-by-side

### Sophisticated tumor identification

![Tumor identification](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_tumor_id.jpg)

Powerful tumor identification algorithms can be applied directly to slides of interest - including slides stained for immune cells - without the need to stain for a separate tumor marker

### Fast analysis

![Fast analysis](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_fast.jpg)

Large image regions are split into tiles where necessary, and these tiles analyzed in parallel with efficient algorithms - giving fast results without requiring specialist hardware

### Flexible object classification

![Object classification](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_classification.jpg)

Apply object classification with the default ‘out-of-the-box’ random forest classifier (from [OpenCV](www.opencv.org)), or create highly-customized algorithms by tuning the choice of classifier, parameters and features used

### Interactive tools

![Interactive tools](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_interactive.jpg)

Extensive tools for slide navigation, annotating areas, exporting image regions or counting cells - either manually, or using automated cell detection

### User-friendly automated analysis

![User-friendly analysis](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_friendly.jpg)

Workflows provide guided analysis for common tasks, or users can devise their own approaches by running commands in any order, which are automatically logged for reproducibility

### Stain estimation

![Stain estimation](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_stains.jpg)

Analysis can be tailored to different stains and scanners using advanced stain estimation, visualization & optimization tools

### Scripting

![Scripting](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_scripting.jpg)

Experienced users can enter commands and write scripts to perform sophisticated, customized analysis using QuPath’s powerful, efficient hierarchical data structures

### Data exchange

![Data exchange](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_imagej.jpg)

Exchange data with open source tools (e.g. [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)), or read images from a variety of sources, including cloud-based hosting

### Analytics & export

![Analytics and export](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_analytics.jpg)

Create interactive results tables, histograms, scatterplots & survival curves directly within QuPath, or export results in standard formats to import into other software if required

### Visualization

![Visualization](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_visualization.jpg)

View measurements in context by color coding objects according to their features, e.g. to identify hotspots or visualize cell distributions for immuno-oncology applications

### Versatility

![Versatility](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/images/features/qupath_versatility.jpg)

QuPath has been developed as a cross-platform application that runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux to support a wide range of applications and image types across pathology and the biosciences
